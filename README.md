# Voron2-350-mods
Various mods for my Voron 2.4 350

Here you can find all the mods I made to my Voron 2.4 350 printer. Some of these mods are/will be submitted to the [VoronDesign/VoronUsers](https://github.com/VoronDesign/VoronUsers/tree/master/printer_mods/ScramblerUSA) repository, but the process is slow and some mods do not deserve to be published to the official repo, or do not fit (either they include electronics/firmware changes, or derived from other projects). All the work in progress will also be published here.

## Mods

### Activated Carbon Exhaust
This mod allows usage of loose activated carbon (pellets, granules) with a standard exhaust housing. There is also a version with 3-way filament outlets.

### ClockWork2 Filament Sensor (for ERCF)
My honest attempt to modify Clockwork 2 so that it includes a filament sensor, while trying to preserve stealth-geometry-style of the thing.

### Carbon Fiber Tube
Plastic parts needed to easily convert from aluminum profile to a carbon fiber tube.

### Connectors and stuff

### DryBox Spool Holder
Side-mounted filament dry box to replace the standard spool holder

### Klicky Probe Mods
A few mods for Klicky Probe

### Macros
Cool, useful and quality-of-life improvement macros

### Quick Release Panel Clips
Quick release Panel Clips inspired by Annex Engineering

### Revo Nozzle Holder
Version that holds 5 nozzles

### Skirt Storage
In-skirt tool and part storage box similar to Ender3 V2

### Smart Filament Sensor
Homemade version of BTT's Smart Filament Sensor. Cheaper? Maybe not. But definitely better and customizable.

## SpoolHolder with a roller
Let's roll!

## Work in progress

### Sensor-based heatbed cutoff

### Fast homing with distance sensors
